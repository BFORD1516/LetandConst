//What is the difference between var and let?
//•	In JavaScript, both var and let are used for variable declaration, but there are some key differences between them. These differences primarily relate to their scoping behavior.
//What is the difference between var and const?
//•	Variables declared with var can be reassigned and updated throughout their scope.
//•	Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned once they have been assigned a value.
//What is the difference between var and const?
//•	In modern JavaScript, it is recommended to use const by default and only use let when you need to reassign a variable.
//What is hoisting?
//•	Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use a variable or call a function before it's declared in the code.
